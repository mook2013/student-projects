# Sieve of Eratosthenes using Queues #

  For this homework assignment we simply had to write a program that used queues or linked lists to calculate primes using the sieve of Eratosthenes. We were allowed to use the datastructures in the Java API. We got <b>extra credit</b> for Javadoc (Sieve.java), doing performance testing on different datastructure types for the queueu, and writing our own Queue.

  I did all of the extra credit. It was a particularly good learning experience to write my own queue that implements the queue interface. For that I had to write my own iterator. It ran into a few different bugs and challenges that made the project take longer than I expected. But it was well worth my saturday afternoon :).
